# Voxel Game

Small game to see what I can do with Three JS Fiber

## Preparing OBJ models

To load the objects in Three JS it's recomended to us .GLTF files. These can then be converted to JSX Components. \
To convert the OBJ model to GLTF use the command `obj2gltf -i model.obj` (see [https://github.com/CesiumGS/obj2gltf](CesiumGS/obj2gltf) for more info)\
To convert the GLTF model to JSX Component use [https://gltf.pmnd.rs/](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/). The generated code can be used as a react component.\
